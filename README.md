# pythonrental
A python program which mimics an video game rental system. System allows the users to enter their coustomer ids, which are validated (along with a game id when neccessary) then allows them to either return, rent, search or complete inventory pruning. 
This project has some implementions of test case in each python file 
This is a projet I want to return to and create an GUI, and ipywidgets.
